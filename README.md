## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
Ensure you have Java installed and set up on your machine to run the programs.

## Features
- Implementation of various hashing algorithms
- Solutions to common DSA problems using hashing
- Well-documented code with examples

## Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in its respective Java file. You can run the files directly to test the implementations. For example:
```bash
java HashingExample
```

## Algorithms Included
- Hash Table Implementation
- Separate Chaining
- Open Addressing
- Collision Resolution Techniques
- Applications of Hashing (e.g., Anagrams, Count Frequencies)
